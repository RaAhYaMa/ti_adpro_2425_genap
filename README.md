# Clean Code and Secure Coding Reflection

I have implemented two new features using Spring Boot and followed clean code principles and secure coding practices in my source code.

## Clean Code Principles

- **Meaningful Names**: I have used meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code easy to understand. For example, in the `ProductController` class, I have used meaningful names for the functions such as `createProduct`, `editProduct`, and `deleteProduct`.

- **Function Do One Thing**: I have made sure that each function does only one thing and does it well. For example, in the `ProductService` class, I have created separate functions for creating, editing, and deleting a product.

- **Abstraction of Objects and Data Structures**: I have used abstraction to hide the implementation details of objects and data structures. For example, in the `ProductRepository` class, I have used an interface to define the methods for accessing the product data.

- **Error Handling**: I have handled errors properly by using try-catch blocks and throwing meaningful exceptions. For example, in the `ProductService` class, I have used try-catch blocks to handle errors when creating, editing, or deleting a product.

## Secure Coding Practices

- **Input Data Validation**: I have validated all input data to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Output Data Encoding**: I have encoded all output data to prevent attacks such as XSS. For example, in the `ProductController` class, I have used the `Thymeleaf` template engine to encode the output data when displaying the product list.
